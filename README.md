# Underwater Debris Detection using YOLO



## Overview

This project showcases a custom-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model designed to detect underwater debris. 
Underwater debris poses significant threats to marine ecosystems, and detecting it accurately can support conservation and cleanup initiatives.

Using a specially curated dataset of underwater images, the YOLO model was trained and evaluated to identify various types of debris in different aquatic environments.
